                    <li>Hello students of BASIS Cedar Park. My name's Priyanka and I am running for secretary in the LiuVelkur Campaign. I am currently in my freshman year of high school, and I have been at BASIS Austin from 2021-2023 and I've been attending BASIS Cedar Park since 2023.

Thanks! </li>
